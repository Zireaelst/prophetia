# 🎬 PROPHETIA Demo Video Script
**Duration: 3-5 minutes | Professional Production**

---

## Video Overview

**Target Audience:** Investors, developers, crypto enthusiasts, potential users
**Tone:** Professional yet accessible, exciting but not hype-y
**Style:** Screen recording + voiceover, cinematic transitions, branded graphics

---

## Scene 1: Opening (0:00 - 0:20)

### Visual
- Fade in from black
- PROPHETIA logo appears with glowing purple/blue gradient
- Crystal ball 🔮 icon animates in
- Tagline fades in: "Divine the Future. Reveal Nothing."

### Voiceover
> "Traditional oracle networks have a fatal flaw: they sacrifice privacy for verification. What if you could have both?"

### Graphics
- Split screen showing:
  - LEFT: Traditional oracle (data exposed, red warning icons)
  - RIGHT: PROPHETIA (data encrypted, green lock icons)

---

## Scene 2: The Problem (0:20 - 0:45)

### Visual
- Animated infographic showing centralized oracle vulnerabilities
- Chainlink logo with "Single Point of Failure" label
- Price chart manipulation animation
- Dollar signs representing high costs ($0.50-$1.00)

### Voiceover
> "Chainlink and other oracles force data providers to expose sensitive information on-chain. This creates trust barriers, privacy concerns, and costs that can reach a dollar per query. Worse, there's no way to cryptographically verify that computations ran correctly."

### Graphics
- Statistics appear:
  - "$350M+ oracle market"
  - "$100M+ lost to oracle exploits"
  - "No privacy protection"

---

## Scene 3: The Solution (0:45 - 1:15)

### Visual
- Smooth transition to PROPHETIA architecture diagram
- Three-layer animation:
  1. Private Data (encrypted)
  2. ZK-ML Inference Engine
  3. Public Predictions (verified)

### Voiceover
> "Introducing PROPHETIA: the first zero-knowledge machine learning oracle on blockchain. Built on Aleo, PROPHETIA lets you upload private data, deploy encrypted ML models, and generate public predictions—all with cryptographic proofs of correctness. Private inputs. Public outputs. Complete verification."

### Graphics
- Flow diagram animates:
  - Data Provider → Encrypted Upload
  - Model Creator → ZK Model Deployment
  - Oracle → divine_future() inference
  - Result → Verified Prediction + ZK Proof

### Voiceover
> "Let me show you how it works. Here's Alice, a data provider with historical stock data for Apple. She uploads it to PROPHETIA with a quality score of 95 out of 100. Notice: the raw data never leaves her machine. Only an encrypted hash is posted on-chain."

### Action
- Click "Upload Data" button
- Loading animation (2 seconds)
- Success notification: "Data uploaded! Transaction: aleo1abc..."

- Show prediction interface with real-time progress

### Voiceover
> "Now the magic happens. PROPHETIA's oracle selects Alice's data and Bob's model, then runs inference using our divine_future() transition. This is zero-knowledge machine learning—the computation happens on-chain with cryptographic proof, but the inputs remain private."

### Action
- Show inference progress bar
- Display steps:
  1. Loading data record ✅
  2. Loading model ✅
  3. Running ZK-ML inference... (animated)
